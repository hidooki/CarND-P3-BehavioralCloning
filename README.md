## CarND-P3-BehavioralCloning

This is the third project in the Udacity [Self Driving Car Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) Nanodegree Program. It consists in training a neural network to drive a car around a track, using data collected with a simulator. A detailed description is included in the [writeup](https://github.com/hidooki/CarND-P3-BehavioralCloning/blob/master/writeup.md), while the mp4 video is the final result, a movie of the laps completed in autonomous driving mode.
