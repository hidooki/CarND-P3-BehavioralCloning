This is the third project in the Udacity [Self Driving Car Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) "nanodegree" program. It consists in training a neural network to drive a car around a track, using data collected with a simulator. A detailed description is included in the [writeup](https://github.com/hidooki/CarND-P2-TrafficSignClassifier/blob/master/writeup.md).
